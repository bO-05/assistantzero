# Fixes Applied - All Features Now Working

## âœ… Fixed Issues:

### 1. Workspace Settings Page (FIXED)
**Problem:** `/workspaces/{id}/settings` returned 404

**Solution:**
- Created `src/app/workspaces/[id]/settings/page.tsx`
- Full edit form with name, description, color picker
- Uses existing `updateWorkspace` server action
- Saves and redirects back to workspace detail

**Test:**
1. Go to `/workspaces`
2. Click "Manage" on any workspace
3. Click "Edit workspace settings"
4. Change name/description/color
5. Click "Save Changes"
6. âœ… Should redirect back with updated workspace

---

### 2. Workspace Creation Form (FIXED)
**Problem:** `/workspaces/new` showed "coming soon" message with no form

**Solution:**
- Replaced placeholder with actual creation form
- Fields: name (required), description (optional), color theme
- Uses existing `createWorkspace` server action
- Creates workspace in database with Auth0 FGA relations
- Redirects to workspace list after creation

**Test:**
1. Go to `/workspaces`
2. Click "New workspace" button
3. Fill in name (e.g., "Work")
4. Optionally add description
5. Pick a color
6. Click "Create Workspace"
7. âœ… Should redirect to `/workspaces` with new workspace listed

### 3. Document RAG Status
**Status:** Embeddings ARE being generated on upload

**How it works:**
1. User uploads document at `/documents`
2. File is processed (PDF text extraction or plain text)
3. Content is chunked using `llm-chunk`
4. Each chunk is embedded using Mistral AI (`mistral-embed`)
5. Embeddings stored in database with document ID
6. When AI needs documents, it:
   - Generates embedding for user's query
   - Searches for similar chunks using cosine distance
   - Filters results through Auth0 FGA (can_view relation)
   - Returns relevant content to AI

**Why AI might not mention documents:**
- AI may not call `getContextDocumentsTool` if question doesn't seem document-related
- Try asking: "What documents do I have?" or "Summarize my documents"
- Or be specific: "What does my resume say about my experience?"

**Test:**
1. Upload a document at `/documents`
2. Wait for "Successfully uploaded" message
3. In chat, ask: "What documents do I have?"
4. Or: "Summarize [filename]"
5. âœ… AI should call `getContextDocumentsTool` and return results
